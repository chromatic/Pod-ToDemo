Pod::ToDemo
-----------

Pod::ToDemo allows pure-POD tutorials to write demonstration programs when
invoked directly from the command line.  This is an easy way to provide
working, tweakable programs for people who've just read a tutorial.

For example, SDL::Tutorial, the bare-bones Perl SDL tutorial, will write a demo program given the command line:

  $ perl -MSDL::Tutorial=sdl_demo.pl -e 1
