Pod::ToDemo allows pure-POD tutorials to write demonstration programs when
invoked directly from the command line.  This is an easy way to provide
working, tweakable programs for people who've just read a tutorial.

For example, SDL::Tutorial, the bare-bones Perl SDL tutorial, will write a demo program given the command line:

	$ perl -MSDL::Tutorial=sdl_demo.pl -e 1

INSTALLATION
------------

Use Module::Build 0.18 or newer.  A backwards-compatible Makefile.PL can
install this for you, if you so desire.

	$ perl Build.PL
	$ ./Build
	$ ./Build test
	$ ./Build install

If you'd rather install by hand, install also Test::Simple 0.47 or newer and
Test::Exception.  These are only necessary to run the tests, though they're
good modules and you really ought to have them anyway.

USAGE
-----

See the documentation, which really ought to write itself to a demo file.
Patches welcome!
